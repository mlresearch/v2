title: 'AClass: A simple, online, parallelizable algorithm for probabilistic classification'
abstract: We present AClass, a simple, online, parallelizable algorithm for supervised
  multiclass classification. AClass models each class-conditional density as a Chinese
  restaurant process mixture, and performs approximate inference in this model using
  a sequential Monte Carlo scheme. AClass combines several strengths of previous approaches
  to classification that are not typically found in a single algorithm; it supports
  learning from missing data and yields sensibly regularized nonlinear decision boundaries
  while remaining computationally efficient. We compare AClass to several standard
  classification algorithms and show competitive performance.
