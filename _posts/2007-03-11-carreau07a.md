title: A Hybrid Pareto Model for Conditional Density Estimation of Asymmetric Fat-Tail
  Data
abstract: 'We propose an estimator for the conditional density $p(Y \mid X)$ that can adapt
  for asymmetric heavy tails which might depend on X. Such estimators have important
  applications in nance and insurance. We draw from Extreme Value Theory the tools
  to build a hybrid unimodal density having a parameter controlling the heaviness
  of the upper tail. This hybrid is a Gaussian whose upper tail has been replaced
  by a generalized Pareto tail. We use this hybrid in a multi-modal mixture in order
  to obtain a nonparametric density estimator that can easily adapt for heavy tailed
  data. To obtain a conditional density estimator, the parameters of the mixture estimator
  can be seen as functions of $X$ and these functions learned. We show experimentally
  that this approach better models the conditional density in terms of likelihood
  than compared competing algorithms : conditional mixture models with other types
  of components and multivariate nonparametric models.'
