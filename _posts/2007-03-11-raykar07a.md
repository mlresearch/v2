title: A fast algorithm for learning large scale preference relations
abstract: We consider the problem of learning the ranking function that maximizes
  a generalization of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic on training data. Relying
  on an -exact approximation for the error-function, we reduce the computational complexity
  of each iteration of a conjugate gradient algorithm for learning ranking functions
  from $O(m^2)$, to $O(m)$, where $m$ is the size of the training data. Experiments on public
  benchmarks for ordinal regression and collaborative filtering show that the proposed
  algorithm is as accurate as the best available methods in terms of ranking accuracy,
  when trained on the same data, and is several orders of magnitude faster.
