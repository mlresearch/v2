title: Analogical Reasoning with Relational Bayesian Sets
abstract: 'Analogical reasoning depends fundamentally on the ability to learn and
  generalize about relations between objects. There are many ways in which objects
  can be related, making automated analogical reasoning very challenging. Here we
  develop an approach which, given a set of pairs of related objects $\mathbf{S} = \{A^1:B^1,
  A^2:B^2, \ldots, A^N:B^N \}$, measures how well other pairs $A:B$ fit in with the set $\mathbf{S}$.
  This addresses the question: is the relation between objects $A$ and $B$ analogous to
  those relations found in $\mathbf{S}$? We recast this classical problem as a problem of Bayesian
  analysis of relational data. This problem is nontrivial because direct similarity
  between objects is not a good way of measuring analogies. For instance, the analogy
  between an electron around the nucleus of an atom and a planet around the Sun is
  hardly justified by isolated, non-relational, comparisons of an electron to a planet,
  and a nucleus to the Sun. We develop a generative model for predicting the existence
  of relationships and extend the framework of Ghahramani and Heller (2005) to provide
  a Bayesian measure for how analogous a relation is to other relations. This sheds
  new light on an old problem, which we motivate and illustrate through practical
  applications in exploratory data analysis.'
