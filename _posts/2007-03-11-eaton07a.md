title: Exact Bayesian structure learning from uncertain interventions
abstract: We show how to apply the dynamic programming algorithm of Koivisto and Sood
  [KS04, Koi06], which computes the exact posterior marginal edge probabilities $p(G_{ij}
  = 1 \mid D)$ of a DAG $G$ given data $D$, to the case where the data is obtained by interventions
  (experiments). In particular, we consider the case where the targets of the interventions
  are a priori unknown. We show that it is possible to learn the targets of intervention
  at the same time as learning the causal structure. We apply our exact technique
  to a biological data set that had previously been analyzed using MCMC [SPP+ 05,
  EW06, WGH06].
