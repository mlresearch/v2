title: Emerge and spread models and word burstiness
abstract: Several authors have recently studied the problem of creating exchangeable
  models for natural languages that exhibit word burstiness. Word burstiness means
  that a word that has appeared once in a text should be more likely to appear again
  than it was to appear in the first place. In this article the different existing
  methods are compared theoretically through a unifying framework. New models that
  do not satisfy the exchangeability assumption but whose probability revisions only
  depend on the word counts of what has previously appeared, are introduced within
  this framework. We will refer to these models as two-stage conditional presence/abundance
  models since they, just like some recently introduced models for the abundance of
  rare species in ecology, seperate the issue of presence from the issue of abundance
  when present. We will see that the widely used TF-IDF heuristic for information
  retrieval follows naturally from these models by calculating a cross-entropy. We
  will also discuss a connection between TF-IDF and file formats that seperate presence
  from abundance given presence.
