title: Sparse Nonparametric Density Estimation in High Dimensions Using the Rodeo
abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the joint density of a d-dimensional
  random vector X = (X_1 , X_2, ..., X_d ) when d is large. We assume that the density
  is a product of a parametric component and a nonparametric component which depends
  on an unknown subset of the variables. Using a modification of a recently developed
  nonparametric regression framework called rodeo (regularization of derivative expectation
  operator), we propose a method to greedily select bandwidths in a kernel density
  estimate. It is shown empirically that the density rodeo works well even for very
  high dimensional problems. When the unknown density function satisfies a suitably
  defined sparsity condition, and the parametric baseline density is smooth, the approach
  is shown to achieve near optimal minimax rates of convergence, and thus avoids the
  curse of dimensionality.
