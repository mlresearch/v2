title: Loop Corrected Belief Propagation
abstract: 'We propose a method for improving Belief Propagation (BP) that takes into
  account the influence of loops in the graphical model. The method is a variation
  on and generalization of the method recently introduced by Montanari and Rizzo [2005].
  It consists of two steps: (i) standard BP is used to calculate cavity distributions
  for each variable (i.e. probability distributions on the Markov blanket of a variable
  for a modified graphical model, in which the factors involving that variable have
  been removed); (ii) all cavity distributions are combined by a message-passing algorithm
  to obtain consistent single node marginals. The method is exact if the graphical
  model contains a single loop. The complexity of the method is exponential in the
  size of the Markov blankets. The results are very accurate in general: the error
  is often several orders of magnitude smaller than that of standard BP, as illustrated
  by numerical experiments.'
