title: Treelets | A Tool for Dimensionality Reduction and Multi-Scale Analysis of
  Unstructured Data
abstract: In many modern data mining applications, such as analysis of gene expression
  or word-document data sets, the data is high-dimensional with hundreds or even thousands
  of variables, unstructured with no specific order of the original variables, and
  noisy. Despite the high dimensionality, the data is typically redundant with underlying
  structures that can be represented by only a few features. In such settings and
  specifically when the number of variables is much larger than the sample size, standard
  global methods may not perform well for common learning tasks such as classification,
  regression and clustering. In this paper, we present treelets â€“ a new tool for multi-resolution
  analysis that extends wavelets on smooth signals to general unstructured data sets.
  By construction, treelets provide an orthogonal basis that reflects the internal
  structure of the data. In addition, treelets can be useful for feature selection
  and dimensionality reduction prior to learning. We give a theoretical analysis of
  our algorithm for a linear mixture model, and present a variety of situations where
  treelets outperform classical principal component analysis, as well as variable
  selection schemes such as supervised (sparse) PCA.
