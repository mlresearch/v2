title: A Fast Bundle-based Anytime Algorithm for Poker and other Convex Games
abstract: Convex games are a natural generalization of matrix (normal-form) games
  that can compactly model many strategic interactions with interesting structure.
  We present a new anytime algorithm for such games that leverages fast best-response
  oracles for both players to build a model of the overall game. This model is used
  to identify search directions; the algorithm then does an exact minimization in
  this direction via a specialized line search. We test the algorithm on a simplified
  version of Texas Holdâ€™em poker represented as an extensive-form game. Our algorithm
  approximated the exact value of this game within 0.20 (the maximum pot size is 310.00)
  in a little over 2 hours, using less than 1.5GB of memory; finding a solution with
  comparable bounds using a state-of-theart interior-point linear programming algorithm
  took over 4 days and 25GB of memory.
