title: A Latent Space Approach to Dynamic Embedding of Co-occurrence Data
abstract: 'We consider dynamic co-occurrence data, such as author-word links in papers
  published in successive years of the same conference. For static co-occurrence data,
  researchers often seek an embedding of the entities (authors and words) into a lowdimensional
  Euclidean space. We generalize a recent static co-occurrence model, the CODE model
  of Globerson et al. (2004), to the dynamic setting: we seek coordinates for each
  entity at each time step. The coordinates can change with time to explain new observations,
  but since large changes are improbable, we can exploit data at previous and subsequent
  steps to find a better explanation for current observations. To make inference tractable,
  we show how to approximate our observation model with a Gaussian distribution, allowing
  the use of a Kalman filter for tractable inference. The result is the first algorithm
  for dynamic embedding of co-occurrence data which provides distributional information
  for its coordinate estimates. We demonstrate our model both on synthetic data and
  on author-word data from the NIPS corpus, showing that it produces intuitively reasonable
  embeddings. We also provide evidence for the usefulness of our model by its performance
  on an author-prediction task.'
