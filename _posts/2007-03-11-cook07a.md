title: Visualizing Similarity Data with a Mixture of Maps
abstract: We show how to visualize a set of pairwise similarities between objects
  by using several different two-dimensional maps, each of which captures different
  aspects of the similarity structure. When the objects are ambiguous words, for example,
  different senses of a word occur in different maps, so “river” and “loan” can both
  be close to “bank” without being at all close to each other. Aspect maps resemble
  clustering because they model pair-wise similarities as a mixture of different types
  of similarity, but they also resemble local multi-dimensional scaling because they
  model each type of similarity by a two-dimensional map. We demonstrate our method
  on a toy example, a database of human word association data, a large set of images
  of handwritten digits, and a set of feature vectors that represent words.
